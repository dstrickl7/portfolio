## My process

### Built with

- Adobe XD
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first
- SCSS
- Javascript


### What I learned

This is the first website that I have ever designed and deployed. I discovered how much I enjoyed the design process while also realizing just how challenging it can be to implement complicated layouts. I also learned how to go through the process of registering and hosting a domain as well as deploying a website using SFTP.


### Challenges
- Design - Designing with accessibility in mind, choosing a color scheme that was colorblind friendly as well as meeting contrast standards that also fit the vibe I wanted to convey tripped me up. I also ran into issues with XD where my chosen fonts were no longer available causing me to be unable to see the completed project. I also created my own logo and favicon and I think designers need more credit for just how much goes into actually making these things.
- Development - I had major issues with the contact section layout. I wanted an angled section with a linear gradient going the full screen. I couldn't fix the issue (white space caused by the relatively positioned elements) but I created a workaround using the after psuedo-element that, while not great, got the job done.
- Deployment - Learning how to use FTP and enabling my SSL certificate


### Continued development

- I would like to make the mobile navigation close when the user chooses a link. 
- I would also like to add animation in some way. Maybe have the navbar slide out
- I was alerted to an issue with my layout in Safari browsers on mobile that I need to fix.
- Forms. I didn't realize how complex forms could really be until I needed to send the data and receive it.
